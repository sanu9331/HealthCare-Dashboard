👋 Hi, I'm Sanu Santhosh
🎓 I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate and a self-taught full-stack developer specialized in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I love building scalable, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.

💻 Over the past months, I've worked on several projects including an E-commerce platform, a Blog system, and multiple UI clones (like Netflix and Starbucks), all focused on clean architecture, modern UI/UX, and performance optimization.

🛠️ My toolkit includes:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js, Redux, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Figma.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, Java, C.
Database: MongoDB, SQL, Firebase.
DevOps/Tools: Postman , Git , GitHub , AWS, Firebase, Razorpay.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into backend architecture and advanced React patterns to build production-grade applications.
